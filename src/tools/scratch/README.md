## Narrator Buddy

This is a sample of how we might implement Narrator Buddy. This was an internal tool for taking what narrator would read aloud, and logging it to the console.

Currently this builds as a scratch project in the Terminal solution. It's provided as a reference implementation for how a real narrator buddy might be implemented in the future.
